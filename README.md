# NSTTF
Not So Tiny Tensor Flow

## Plan

1. **Defining Goals and Scope**:
   - Study existing libraries and determine what tasks they solve.
   - Formulate the goals of our library: what problems it should solve, what features it should provide.

2. **Designing the API**:
   - Design the library's interface, defining classes and functions that will be included in the API.
   - Pay special attention to usability and intuitive understanding of the interface.

3. **Implementing Basic Data Structures**:
   - Start by creating basic data structures for representing the computational graph: classes for nodes, operations, connections between nodes, etc.
   - Implement basic methods for managing these data structures.

4. **Implementation of Operation Execution**:
   - Develop algorithms for optimizing and executing operations in the graph.
   - Implement methods for resource allocation and operation execution on different devices.

5. **Testing**:
   - Write tests for all components of our library to ensure their correct operation.
   - Ensure full code coverage with tests to minimize the likelihood of errors.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Create detailed documentation describing each class and function of our library.
   - Explain the main concepts and methods of working with the library so that users can easily understand how to use it.

7. **Integration and Demonstration**:
   - Integrate our library into simple examples or small projects to demonstrate its capabilities.
   - Prepare a presentation or demonstration video showing how to use our library to solve various tasks.

8. **Report**:
   - Write a report on the work done, describing all stages of development, problems encountered, and ways to solve them.
   - Provide code samples and test results.

9. **Defense of the Coursework**:
   - Prepare for the defense of our coursework before teachers or experts, preparing a presentation and answers to questions.

10. **Further Development**:
    - Continue to develop our library, taking into account user feedback and adding new features and capabilities.
    - Maintain active communication with the community and provide updates and bug fixes.
